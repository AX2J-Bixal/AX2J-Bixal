## 👨🏽‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡  I’m always exploring new technologies, particularly in the data, security, and DevOps space—optimizing workflows, automating processes, and improving system resilience. Shoutout to Databricks and Terraform!

🎓  I earned my Master’s in Cybersecurity from NYU Tandon in 2024 after completing their Bridge Program, transitioning from eight years in social services to a tech-driven career.

🌱  I’m currently focused on system architecture, data pipelines, infrastructure as code, and security best practices.

✍️  My goal is to build clean, efficient, and secure solutions—leveraging deep knowledge of algorithms, SQL, and cloud systems to drive innovation while making technology more accessible and impactful.
